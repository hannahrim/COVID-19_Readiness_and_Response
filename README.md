# COVID-19_Readiness_and_Response
  Our team will be communicating through Slack and Email. The team will utilize Asana as a project management tool to manage and track the team's project. The PM will check in with each team member and schedule one-on-ones to ensure deliverables are completed on time. We have and will use Zoom for team meetings.
